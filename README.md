# Winking Panda Login Interface 🐼

***

## 📋 Project Summary
**This project was prepared as a "Learning and Development" study to apply theoretical knowledge from the "User Experience (UX) Design" course at Anadolu University using web technologies (Vanilla JS & CSS3).**

**The primary goal of the project is to provide a visually oriented user experience by combining CSS positioning capabilities with basic JavaScript event handling.**

## 🚀 Project Details

### Dynamic Interaction
* **Peek-a-boo Effect:** When the password input field is focused, the panda figure covers its eyes with its hands, creating an interactive "peek-a-boo" animation.

### Eye Tracking
* **Visual Feedback:** When the username field is clicked, the pupils move toward the form area to provide intuitive visual feedback to the user.

### Vectorless Drawing
* **Pure CSS Character:** The panda character was created without any external image files (PNG, SVG, etc.). It is constructed entirely using pure CSS code and advanced `border-radius` properties.

### Responsive Structure
* **Adaptive Design:** The interface is structured to maintain its central position and proportions across different screen resolutions and devices.
