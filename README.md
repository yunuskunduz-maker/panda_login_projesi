### << ## **PROJECT SUMMARY** ## >>
***

** **This project was prepared as a "Learning and Development" study to apply theoretical knowledge from the "User Experience (UX) Design" course at Anadolu University using web technologies (Vanilla JS & CSS3).**
** **The primary goal of the project is to provide a visually oriented user experience by combining CSS positioning capabilities with basic JavaScript event handling.**

### << ## **PROJECT DETAILS** ## >>

** **Dynamic Interaction:**
** **When the password input field is focused, the panda figure covers its eyes with its hands, creating a "peek-a-boo" effect.**

** **Eye Tracking:**
** **When the username field is clicked, the pupils move toward the form area to provide visual feedback.**



** **Vectorless Drawing:**
** **The panda character was created without any images (PNG, SVG, etc.), using entirely pure CSS code and border-radius properties.**

** **Responsive Structure:**
** **The design is structured to maintain its central position across different screen resolutions.**
